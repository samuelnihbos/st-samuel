* What is st?
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which suckless. The Suckless team created st as an alternative to traditional, 'bloated' terminal emulators like xterm and rxvt, which have tens of thousands of lines of code.

* Installing my custom st
Download the source code from this repository or use a git clone:

+ git clone https://gitlab.com/samuelnihbos/st-samuel

or you can install this build of st by adding my 3rd party repo. Read the guide [[https://gitlab.com/samuelnihbos/samuel-arch-repo][here]]
